# ADR-001: Implement Comprehensive Testing Strategy

## Status

Proposed

## Context

The Music Tracks App currently has minimal test coverage, with only basic spec files generated by Angular CLI. The project structure follows a clean, modular architecture with feature-based organization, but lacks comprehensive testing to ensure reliability and maintainability as the codebase grows.

Current testing situation:

- Only default Angular spec files exist (\*.spec.ts)
- No integration tests
- No E2E tests
- No testing utilities or helpers
- No test data factories
- No visual regression testing

This lack of testing creates several risks:

- Difficulty in refactoring code safely
- Higher probability of introducing regressions
- Increased time for manual testing
- Lower developer confidence when making changes
- Harder onboarding for new team members

## Decision

We will implement a comprehensive testing strategy with the following components:

### 1. Unit Testing Enhancement

- Achieve minimum 80% code coverage for all business logic
- Create testing utilities and custom matchers
- Implement test data factories using Factory pattern

### 2. Integration Testing

- Add integration tests for API services
- Test component interactions with services
- Implement mock HTTP interceptors for API testing

### 3. E2E Testing Framework

- Set up Cypress for end-to-end testing
- Cover critical user journeys (CRUD operations, audio playback)
- Implement visual regression testing with Percy

### 4. Testing Infrastructure

- Add pre-commit hooks to run tests
- Configure CI/CD pipeline with test stages
- Set up test coverage reporting and badges
- Create testing documentation and guidelines

### 5. Specific Testing Approaches

```typescript
// Example: Test data factory
export class TrackFactory {
  static build(overrides?: Partial<Track>): Track {
    return {
      id: faker.datatype.uuid(),
      title: faker.music.songName(),
      artist: faker.name.fullName(),
      album: faker.lorem.words(2),
      genres: [faker.music.genre()],
      slug: faker.helpers.slugify(faker.music.songName()),
      createdAt: faker.date.past().toISOString(),
      updatedAt: faker.date.recent().toISOString(),
      ...overrides,
    };
  }
}

// Example: Service testing with marble testing for RxJS
it('should handle optimistic updates correctly', () => {
  const track = TrackFactory.build();
  const updated = { ...track, title: 'New Title' };

  cold('-a|', { a: updated })
    .pipe
    // test optimistic update behavior
    ();
});
```

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences

1. **Improved Code Quality**: Bugs will be caught earlier in the development cycle
2. **Safer Refactoring**: Developers can refactor with confidence knowing tests will catch regressions
3. **Better Documentation**: Tests serve as living documentation of how components should behave
4. **Faster Development**: Less time spent on manual testing and debugging
5. **Higher Reliability**: Critical features like audio playback will be thoroughly tested
6. **Easier Onboarding**: New developers can understand the codebase through tests
7. **Continuous Quality Assurance**: Automated tests in CI/CD prevent broken code from reaching production

### Negative Consequences

1. **Initial Time Investment**: Setting up testing infrastructure and writing tests will take 2-3 weeks
2. **Increased Build Time**: CI/CD pipeline will be slower due to test execution (estimated +5-10 minutes)
3. **Maintenance Overhead**: Tests need to be updated when features change
4. **Learning Curve**: Team members may need training on testing best practices and tools
5. **Storage Requirements**: Visual regression tests will require additional storage for screenshots
6. **False Positives**: Flaky tests may occasionally fail without actual issues, requiring investigation
7. **Development Velocity**: Initial development may be slower as developers write tests alongside features

### Mitigation Strategies

- Prioritize testing critical paths first (audio playback, CRUD operations)
- Use test parallelization to reduce CI/CD time
- Implement retry mechanisms for flaky tests
- Provide team training sessions on testing best practices
- Create shared testing utilities to reduce boilerplate

## Implementation Plan

1. **Week 1**: Set up testing infrastructure (Cypress, coverage tools, CI/CD integration)
2. **Week 2**: Create testing utilities and factories, write unit tests for services
3. **Week 3**: Implement integration tests and E2E tests for critical paths
4. **Ongoing**: Maintain 80% coverage for new code, refactor existing tests as needed
